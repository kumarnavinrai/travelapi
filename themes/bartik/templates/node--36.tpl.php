	<p>Desired by empires for over centuries, acting as a concord between Europe and Asia and is considered as one of the world&#39;s mighty metropolises is Istanbul. Its origin dates back to around 1000BC when the city of Byzantium grew into the byzantine empires great capital of Constantinople and was renamed Istanbul again after the Turkish founding. This city has a rich cultural heritage and history associated with it. The Topkapi Palace is a fine example of grand and luxurious architecture which was built in the 15th century and has a sprawling display of Islamic arts, opulent gardens, and traditional intricate hand painted tile work. The Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Camii) was sultan Ahmet&#39;s majestic architectural gift to his capital; the mosque gets its name from the interior which is decorated with ten thousand Iznik tiles. The Basilica Cistern (Yerebatan Sarni&#231;i) is one of Istanbul&#39;s most astonishing tourist attractions which seems to be like an underground palace which is supported by an enormous number of columns.</p>
