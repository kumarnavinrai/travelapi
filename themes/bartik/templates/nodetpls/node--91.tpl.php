<p>Enthroned between Stockholm, St Petersburg and Tallin on the splendid north coast of Finland is the beautiful city of Helsinki which is also the largest city and the capital Finland. This city is the core of the country’s cultural, political, research, business, and education development. It’s a serene seaside city with open spaces, historical buildings, and lush green parks. It has more than 300 islands which are interconnected by a maze of bridges. It’s a perfect weekend getaway and an ideal holiday destination. The Aleksanterinkatu Street is one of the most popular shopping streets and also known for its cafes and restaurants that serve local authentic cuisine. Situated in the south harbor is the market street where a number of vendors sell fresh locally grown produce and an array of other goods. The national museum of art is one of the most popular museums in Finland that has some spectacular pieces of artwork, sculptures, drawings and graphics.</p>
