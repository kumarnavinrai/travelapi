<p>In a city so filled with immemorial times and faith in Christ, it gets confusing for visitors as to which place should they visit first. The Vatican City is the tiniest independent state in the world with an area of less than a square kilometer. In the interior of the Vatican palace and gardens is the St Peters square and St Peters basilica, an area which is governed by the pope who is considered to be the supreme head of the Roman Catholic Church. St Peters basilica houses Michelangelo's masterpiece, Pieta, along with altars and statuary by Bernini and others. The Pantheon is the finest monument of the roman antiquity which has been preserved for over 2000 years and is still intact till date.
