<p>Moscow is situated on the Moskva River which is in the north of Russia and is also the sprawling capital of this majestic country. The country is known for its history which stretches way back in time and also for its grand architecture and monuments and its involvement in arts. At the zenith of political power and once the center of the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin is a vital part not only of the city but also of the nation. One can visit the five church museums and the patriarchâ€™s palace in order to get a better insight of the ancient style and architecture. The magnificent Cathedral of Christ the Savior was completed in 1997, the same year when Moscow completed 850 years. The cathedrals sheer size and splendid architecture is a treat to the eyes. The Gorky Park is an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city where one can indulge in activities such as cycling, rollerblading and beach volleyball.</p>
