<p>The capital of the monarchy of the Netherlands is the ravishing city of Amsterdam. This city is the major cultural hub in the country, known for its historical museums, amazing theaters, and entertainment venues. The city is well known for its historic homes which were built in the 16th and 18th century all of them cramped in 2000 acres. The city is also famous for its 8 wooden picturesque bridges from which Magere Brug (Mager Bridge) is the most popular of all. The Rijksmuseum is one of Amsterdam&#39;s significant art repositories and it&#39;s also very popular among tourists. The museum&#39;s magnificent collection includes around seven million works of art which are spread over two hundred and fifty rooms of this extensive building. Kalverstraat and Vlooienmarkt are the two places where tourists can indulge themselves in some retail therapy. Amsterdam&#39;s West Church (Westerkerk) is the most popular church in the city, and it&#39;s known for its internal and external gothic features.</p>
